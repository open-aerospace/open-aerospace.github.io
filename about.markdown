# About Open Aerospace

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was started by [@natronics](https://github.com/natronics) as an attempt to condense the results of many years of obsessing over rockets into a single place.

My Intention is to dispel myths about rocket flight, and to freely share understanding of this niche, but fascinating topic.

In addition to writing about aerospace the [open-aerospace github organization](https://github.com/open-aerospace) contains a collection of code that may be helpful in running simulations of launch vehicles.
